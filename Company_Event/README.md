Define the LocationEvent class:
The LocationEvent class represents an event and its attributes. It contains methods to extract the event date from the event's webpage and score the event based on keywords and the company name.

Implement the event scoring functionality:
The score_event function takes the event title, keywords, and company name as input and returns an event score. The score is determined based on whether the title contains any of the keywords or the company name. The scoring system assigns a score of 3 for a match with keywords, 1 for a match with the company name, and 0 otherwise.

Implement the event rating functionality:
The rate_event function takes an event score as input and returns a rating ("High," "Medium," or "Low") based on the score.

Implement the event search functionality:
The search_events function performs a Google search for events related to the specified company and AI. It retrieves the search results, extracts the event information (title and link), scores each event using the score_event function, and creates a LocationEvent object for each event.

Accept user input and search for events:
The code prompts the user to enter the company name. It defines a list of keywords and calls the search_events function with the company name and keywords to retrieve the events.

Display the event information:
The event information is formatted into a table using the tabulate function from the tabulate package. The table includes the event title, link, date, event score, and rating. The table is then printed to the console.

Note
Adjust the range parameter in the for loop within the search_events function to specify the number of pages to scrape. Currently, it scrapes 20 pages (10 results per page), but you can modify it based on your needs.

The parse_date method in the LocationEvent class should be customized to parse the date based on the specific format found on the event's webpage. It currently returns the raw date text as a placeholder.

Customize the extract_date_from_html method in the LocationEvent class to match the HTML structure and keywords used to display the date on the event's webpage.

The regular expressions in the extract_date_from_text method in the LocationEvent class are designed to capture date patterns commonly found in text. You can modify or add patterns to match different date formats.

The code assumes Python 3.x syntax.[A[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[C[C[C[C[C[t[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[A[B[B[A[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[B[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[B[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C
